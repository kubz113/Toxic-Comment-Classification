Well I just finished a good bit of editing.  I haven't had a chance to go through and do all the tagging and referencing yet since work calls but I am extremely confident in the scientific factual basis of everything stated in here.  The referencing can pretty much be all made to the book """"Particle Imaging Velocimetry A practical guide"""" by Raffel, Willert, Wereley and Kompenhans if someone can add it.  Also, not sure how to exactly do that as it all can be found in numerous scientific journals, databases, etc. but is so conveniently placed all in that one book.

The only thing I am unsure about as I have no experience with is Molecular Tagging Velocimetry.  To put it simply, I would like to keep technique defects in the summaries but I don't know what this one's is.  To put is bluntly, the description as it is now is too good to be true.  I know it has defects and problems, I don't know what they are.  The fact is the technique was developed in 97ish and is not in widespread use.  If the description were accurate, everyone would use it.  I have met or heard of not one person using it, which means there is some big flaw in the technique that if someone can find, be my guest to add it.

Everything else, please post on discussion page before editing critical information as I am positive what I have said can be completely defended but am open to solid arguments.  I won't be pigheaded about it.

Notability of Your New Heart
 A tag has been placed on Your New Heart requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

While I agree that this article isn't FA material, I must suggest that your added criticism in the lead is also repetitive.  The SPLC's opinion of the show is referenced throughout.  At the very least, your edit should be amended to read that The Political Cesspool has hosted FORMER members of the Ku Klux Klan. In fact, the only one I can find for sure is David Duke, who has also been interviewed by every major talk radio and television program in the country.  (Perhaps it should read, """"a former member of the Ku Klux Klan."""")  Furthermore, Duke was in the Klan in the 1970's, nearly three decades before The Political Cesspool first went on the air.  Does Wolf Blitzer's Wiki entry read that he has hosted Klan members?  Duke has appeared on Blitzer's show.

There are already many people who feel that this article is flagrantly biased.

 Re: The Call of the Marching Bell 

I'm afraid that I've had to revert your edit.  Frst, your change from Bang-i-dara"""" """"Bang-e-Dara"""" wasn't properly explained.  The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses """"BĀNG-E-DARĀ"""" on the title page and """"Bāng-i-Darā"""" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?

Secondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what's the best ratio?:

""""An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:

""""Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century""""

I've replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I've rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk) 

Hi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:
 E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired """"articles""""!
 The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice
 In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any """"source"""" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation 
In your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles.
The use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of """"e"""" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern.

When you use id est or """"That is"""" in that context you are expounding upon and explaining the original sentence, e.g., prohibited in article text, that is"""", you can't use it.

I may be wrong but your reference to WP:HiddenFunction concerns hiding text not to a collapsible table.
'''As of December 29, 2006, this technique is disabled on this wiki. The class hiddenStructure still exists in the CSS, but now outlines the text in green instead of hiding the text. This is to find any remaining instances of hiddenStructure in templates. Note that this only disables use of the CSS class hiddenStructure. It does not prevent use of similar tags like display: none or visibility: hidden.

The collapsible boxes contain information that serves as an addendum to what is in the article. It adds to the reading experience by making the page neater. The example I used with the """"Genes"""" is a prime example, looking at that abortion is enough to give somebody a headache.

The collapsible boxes I added in the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Mathausen concentration camp articles, among others, makes the pages look neater and more interesting. Nobody has complained about:WP:ACCESS.

This article is indeed biased due to the use of adjectives projected upon the EDL. Within the wiki talk page there appears to be sufficient evidence that the characterization of the EDL has not been fact-based, but in some cases the opinion of opposition groups. This very argument is taking place on the talk page of the UAF where they have successfully garnered favorable edits to their own description with the omission of the term left-wing, yet the EDL ‘s group type currently stands as “far right-wing”.  Even when the nature of a topic is agreeably abhorrent, the moment one describes said topic with words such as atrocity or (insert)phobic, the subject has become tainted with opinion.  As the world descends upon Wikipedia to learn about these groups due to recent events; it is vital that factual information be provided. I’ve never heard of the EDL until a few days ago, yet someone like myself, untainted by prejudice; can see this article is biased at face-value. Lacking an omnipotent author, the introductory description of the EDL should largely come from how the EDL describes itself. Any evidence to the contrary should be cited properly where Wikipedia provides. I don’t see how journalistic opinionating and scholarly opinion is anything more than just opinion.67.168.126.47  17:57, 27",0,0,0,0,0,0

Speedy deletion of Desiyou
 A tag has been placed on Desiyou requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 No offense taken, but I see no need to moderate my tone.  Any venom in it I feel is warranted, and I am not the type to tiptoe around anything for the sake of WP:Civility or whatever random set of rules on a page I'll never read.  I speak here the same way I'd speak in an academic forum, in front of a work committee, or in front of Joe Schmoe on the street. I grant no special lee way to - of ALL people - some people on the internet.  Now moving back to the point, the request to move is not a courtesy to her fans, but for all the reasons I stated.  Nowhere did I mention her fans.  If it is a courtesy to anyone, it is to bell hooks herself, out of respect for her personal statement.  And the issue at hand here is why we SHOULD move it, as that is the proposal, and many reasons have been given.  It is not necessary to prove that she """"does not want her name to be capitalized"""".  

Or are you trying to say that such a finding would supersede all other arguments and be grounds upon which to make the move?  If so, then you are being contrary and absurd.  My burden, and those who support the move, was to provide reasons for the move, and it is then up to the opposition to cite reasons against it, which they have not done.  Some have even changed their vote from oppose to support.  Even , for all of his wordiness, seems to be in support of the move, but is just playing his role as administrator, and being cautious before he commits to the move.  I'd say overly so, but that is my opinion.  Even if the lack of """"proof"""" you're looking for was the only reason against the move, the overwhelming reasons for the move supersede it.

Are you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering's attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man's lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his """"mouth"""", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this?

 Thanks for helping to lift the veil on Verbal - More questions 

Elonka - I understand that Verbal did not block me, but is it true that he had nothing to do with it? I am normally much more than civil. I have often been complemented on my diplomacy and tact, but this user's approach to editing seems overly aggressive and not helpful enough. It seems to me that Verbal is abusing his position. Let me give a simple example. There were many edits made to the page in question with much valid data. Verbal simply deleted them with the cryptic note about them being non-notable (nn), or RS (or similar). This does nothing to help those who were attempting to improve the page. There is a term for this kind of bullying when one in the know smacks down new users without giving appropriate guidance. On the page in question. There were dozens of books listed with ISBN numbers. Is that not verifiable enough? If that is inappropriate, what is the 'proper' way to cite books? At the very least his reverts are ham-handed and trashed many valid and verifiable items along with a few that were unverified. How is that helpful? Verbal's standard seems to be if the reference includes a link to another existing Wikipedia page, then it is acceptable. Some of those pages are not sufficiently verifiable themselves. Given Verbal's aggressive approach, why not delete those other pages for lack of verifiability as well? I appreciate your guidance and assistance. I will do my best to bring the deleted content up to the standards once I understand them and once I have a contact like yourself to help keep an eye on Verbal who refused to respond to my previous inquiries. I will use my logged in credentials when I feel I am safe from being abused by Verbal's overly aggressive approach. I do not want to lose my account. He refuses to help or answer valid questions. He simply deletes entries with terse edit summaries. He's not helpful in teaching newer users what he is seeking. That's not what I understood was the helpful nature of the Wikipedia community. Look at all the credentials on his page. It's quite clear that he's an ego maniac. The more credentials, the lower the self-esteem, IMO.  I question whether all of those credentials are even valid. Are they subject to any verification process? Would there be any censure if he were found to be overstating his resume? Thanks for letting me vent.

I'm sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing """"original research"""" based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means """"a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process"""".  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing """"original research"""".  All we can say is """"Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.""""  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say """"Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.""""  There is still room to debate how reliable """"published author Y"""" is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of """"Published author Y"""".  The basic principle here is """"not published => not reliable"""".  And self-published doesn't count.    18:09""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I would be surprised since she told me that she put it here.  I suppose it could be possible.  I made my decision primarily on an extensive personal review of the site.  It seems my judgement that the site is largely based on Nikki's personal experiences, and then a list of people who she knows to be pedophiles, but at some time or another have been naturists.  Her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity, nudism/naturists and pedophilia.  Her words are strong, and certainly her POV.  There is no backing with any research to support her point.  The net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles.  I agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important.  But not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested, some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction.  At any rate, the reason we have guidelines, such as Wikipedia:External_links#Links_normally_to_be_avoided, is to give us guidance in such instances.

1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"admins"""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"personal attacks"""" or """"harassment"""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him and """"smiley girl"""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"vandalism"""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"personal attack"""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?

4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""" or """"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"?

5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"consensus"""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"consensus"""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"consensus"""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"consensus,"""" do the same thing, it's """"edit-warring"""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""" rule)?

 Outline of knowledge WikiProject update - 04/02/2009 

Hi everyone.

Things are going slow again.  Where have you been?!

Maybe what you need to get you going is a little competition...

 Who are we competing with? 

Encyclopedia Britannica.  Specifically, with its Outline of knowledge (presented in its volume called the Propaedia).  Currently, they're kicking our asses.  You've really got to check out their Outline of Knowledge (available only in the encyclopedia's paper edition - not the online version).

Portals. Informally, of course, just for the fun of it.  There are around 600 portals.  We're about 100 behind them, with about 500 outlines.  Let's blow past them and leave 'em in the dust!

 Confusion in editors at large 

Now that the country outlines have been moved to the encyclopedia proper (article space), recruiting help on these is of high priority  it will soon be time to alert all relevant editors to the nature and function of these and how they relate to other country coverage on Wikipedia.

However, I've noticed instances in which editors do not understand the nature and function of outline pages, and complain that they are redundant to articles.  Well, ya.  (That's the point of an outline - to provide the essentials in a structure for greater understanding, for easy viewing and faster reading, and to provide a topical guide).  

A few editors over the years have viewed outlines as redundant to portals, not understanding the purpose and scope of outlines, nor the benefits provided by their structure and standardization.

These problems of misunderstanding need to be solved before """"going public"""", to prevent their expansion as the community's awareness of these pages increases.  Consider the response we'd get now if we announced these pages on the talk pages of 500 WikiProjects, 500 article talk pages, and placed links in 500 see also sections, etc.

That could be a nightmare.

So...

 Encyclopedic and administrative support 

I've been working on a couple things that will help alleviate confusion and hopefully reduce the need for editors to ask questions and seek advice.   They're drafts, still under construction.  Please look these over and jump in and help complete them (directly or by providing feedback):

First is an  article draft, intended to replace the current Outline article.

Next is a  on the Outline of knowledge and its outline pages.

Let me know what you think.  Do they help you understand outlines better and how to develop them on Wikipedia?  What is missing?  How can they be improved?

As formerly stated(before Diderot POV pushed the article with a massive edit) on the Non IE Roots page(), Celtic is another language group holding a considerable amount of Non IE Roots.  Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.

Five of the statements are simply wrong. Mary Baker Eddy was an emphatic and orthodox believer in the virgin birth. She certainly believed in the resurrection and the atonement (there is a chapter on """"Atonement and Eucharist"""" in Science and Health). Heaven and hell are defined in the Glossary of the textbook, though they are understood differently in Christian Science than in mainstream Christianity. (It is true that CS does not adhere to the concept of miracles, seeing healing as a result of laws of nature that are not widely understood.) This section is so wrong that it really needs to be corrected in the interest of the accuracy of the article, whatever one might think of CS per se. I don't have time to root out academic sources on this so I suggest that it simply be removed. The over-riding concern is, surely to give an accurate picture of the topic.

BTW: are you wise and omniscient ones (sarcasm) aware that Federal reserve notes were not legal tender until 1933?

lets see if you read it here 

I believe that Congress does NOT have the power to make paper money a legal tender and does not even have the power to make gold and silver a legal tender.The reference below show clearly that at least one US president and Funding Father agree with me on both counts and that at least two US presidents, and Founding Fathers agree with me on one count.

I hope that claims of original research and synthesis can now be put to rest as BOGUS.

An old NY times article http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res;=9501E2DB133BEE33A25751C1A9669D94679ED7CF references the following quotes

James Madison  - Thus the pretext for a paper currency and particularly for making the bill a legal tender, either for public or private debt, was cut off

Thomas Jefferson - I now deny their (Congress's) power of making paper money, or anything else, a legal tender

A Mr Benton who is also cited, states: The power granted to Congress to coin money is an authority to stamp metallic money, and is not an authority for emitting slips of paper containing promises to pay money.

Per Yale Law School records of the minutes of the vote to TAKE AWAY from Congress the power to """"emit bills of credit"""" during the Constitutional Convention as recorded by Founding Father and future president James Madison  http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp 

FN23 This vote in the affirmative by Virga. was occasioned by the acquiescence of Mr. Madison who became satisfied that striking out the words would not disable the Govt. from the use of public notes as far as they could be safe & proper; & would only cut off the pretext for a paper currency, [FN24] and particularly for making the bills a tender [FN24] either for public or private debts. 

and

""""Mr. Ghorum was for striking out, without inserting any prohibition. if the words stand they may suggest and lead to the measure.""""

My aside: The power to be struck out was the power to """"emit"""". Mr. Ghorum, (Madison misspelled the name - the person is actually Nathanial Gorham) states that if the words stand (the words being """"emit bills of credit"""") that """"they may suggest and lead to the measure"""" with the measure being printing legal tender paper money. To be ABSOLUTELY clear, this vote denied Congress the power to """"emit"""" per money, and strikes at the core of arguments in favor of paper money, because Congress cannot make paper money a legal tender because the power to print paper money was REMOVED from Congress. If Congress cannot even print paper money, how can it make it legal tender?

In Federalist 44 - Madison states 

The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it.

From Craig v Misouri

 In response to Claude's last two posts.  Backwards of course.  Regarding NRMs - if you'll check the list, you'll see that Assemblies of God, Calvary Chapel, Foursquare, and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations.  Just a note.  Also true of the Vineyard Movement, of which there are many comparisons to GCA.  You're right that GCC doesn't like the denominational nametag,   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference.  As far as what a movement is, a couple definitions I found were """"a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal: the antislavery movement; the realistic movement in art."""" and """"An organized effort by supporters of a common goal: a leader of the labor movement.""""
 I say all that to say this.  Movement is a very ambiguous term, more appropriate to an idea.  You're right that GC does use the term frequently.  However, I think the best factual definition, and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro, is """"GCAC is an association of churches"""".  That's what the AC in GCAC stands for.  Really, that's what we actually see in existence - churches.  Somehow we need to differentiate - I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches, because we have to pick a topic - that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors.  So let's start with something real, then trace the history of that association. and the present.
 I will re-edit the Today section.  It is not NPOV at present.  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it.  I was confused about the date, couldn't find it in your reference (I was in a hurry).  We need to focus on what we're doing here - we're putting facts up.  We don't need to interpret or extrapolate.  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership, with one sentence relating that to autonomy.  For that reason, while I think it should stay, it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic.      Again, your statement isn't found in the quote.  The quote itself is fine, and appropriate - i don't see any reason that it needs a qualifier - as the quote i put above from the cong. polity article says, leadership/authority is a common integral part of cong. polity, and as we all have said there is no """"typical view"""" - if we're going to have cong. polity as a term in the GCA article, people need to go there and read it (also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article).  I don't have any problem with  deferring to leaders - i just want accuracy here.  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org (which is listed in several places), especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA.

This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]

The vicious attacks on Ward Churchill

Ward Churchill appears to be the latest author attacked by a strikling super-conservative country. I have been reading a lot about American sociology lately, as it relates to the violent suppresion of the left*.  

I knew little about Churchill, and had a negative view of him because of his 9/11 article and infamous """"little eichman"""" quote.  I then stumbled upon one of his articles:

It was absolutly incredible.  Ward Churchill is an incredible historian. What do these attacks on Ward Churchill do?  They cause Americans to shy away from reading Churchill's work, and they send a clear message to others who may want to attack American foreign policy: that you can lose your job if you criticize America, that you will be attacked viciously if you criticize America.  It is the latest form of American suppression of the Left.

I am just interested if there is a list of authors, or a book or article about those who have been """"Swift Boated"""" like Churchill.  If so, I would like to add this to the article.  I think Americans need to know how America's sophisticated Propoganda system** operates. 

*Including such books as , which asks such questions as why has America had more people killed in labor disputes than any other country?  Why doesn't America have a labor party like other industrialized countries?  Why are union numbers so low in America compared to other industrialized countries?

""""I have the greatest admiration for your propaganda. Propaganda in the West is carried out by experts who have had the best training in the world  in the field of advertizing  and have mastered the techniques with exceptional proficiency ... Yours are subtle and persuasive; ours are crude and obvious ... I think that the fundamental difference between our worlds, with respect to propaganda, is quite simple. You tend to believe yours ... and we tend to disbelieve ours.""""
Soviet correspondent based five years in the U.S.

When I first visited Russia, in 1986, I made friends with a musician whose father had been Brezhnev's personal doctor. One day we were talking about life during 'the period of stagnation' - the Brezhnev era. 'It must have been strange being so completely immersed in propaganda,' I said.

'Ah, but there is the difference. We knew it was propaganda,' replied Sacha. 

That is the difference. Russian propaganda was so obvious that most Russians were able to ignore it. They took it for granted that the government operated in its own interests and any message coming from it was probably slanted - and they discounted it.

In the West the calculated manipulation of public opinion to serve political and ideological interests is much more covert and therefore much more effective. Its greatest triumph is that we generally don't notice it - or laugh at the notion it even exists.

With due respect this dog's breakfast of an article deserves a POV rampage and a much more exhaustive one than the minor changes made on December 11. Please look over some of the undocumented, irrelevant, and in some cases just plain weird interpretations of Revelation that were removed or edited and suggest which edits should be undone. The article as a whole is unnecessarily repetitive and only a small fraction of it represents the views of modern scholarship (see my comments above under Talk section 11: Everyone's view).

On Thomas Jefferson: Myth America I sympathise with your concern to '[provide] a useful contrast to the other interpretations in the article' which generally reflect conservative christian in-fighting about the meaning of the book but tell us very little about Revelation itself. I'm not convinced, however, that to dismiss the work as the incoherent ravings of an early christian """"heretic"""" (Cerinthus) is the best way to do this. A number of scholars have demonstrated that the book follows a clearly marked concentric structure which evidences balanced literary construction, while it has long been acknowledged that Revelation parodies and inverts the imagery of first century roman imperialism and the emperor cult in particular to make it's point (see eg Steven J Friesen's recent work in this area: Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John). This hardly supports Jefferson's view that the work is a meaningless rant but nor does it support the highly subjective perspectives of historicism and futurism which have obviously irritated you. A balanced, well documented historical-critical introduction to the work should, in my opinion, make up the bulk of this article with other conservative christian approaches acknowledged separately in brief, concise fashion. I am quite happy for the Jefferson reference to remain for its whimsical value and tentatively suggest that it could be accompanied by some of the numerous historical warnings by prominent christian leaders and commentators about the danger of misusing the book.

I also note that the reference to Mithraic parallels has been re-inserted in the Authorship section. What this has to do with the question of authorship I have no idea. The parallel itself is completely unconvincing and the book from which it is taken is a typical example of an author falling in love with his subject and unnecessarily exaggerating its importance. While I don't deny that the work, by Payam Nabarz, represents a good layman's guide to Mithraism the suggested parallel between this quote and Revelation 1:4-20 on page 51 (see Google books for the text) hardly warrants the preface that the two are 'almost identical' or the overly enthusiastic observation that 'the [similarity of] spirit is abundant... to the extent that the names of Jesus and Mithras could be interchangeable'. These are not the remarks of a careful exegete. It is quite likely that there are echoes of Mithraism, the religion of the roman army, in Revelation, which freely reuses both Jewish and greco-roman mythology in polemical fashion, but this is not one of them. Would anyone object to a re-removal of this paragraph?
  

""""this... article deserves a POV rampage""""— All I can say to that is read this WP:NPOV.
Why not be inclusionist instead of deleting chunks of information you don't personally agree with? An encylopedia is supposed to present all legitimate views, not stick with just one/the most popular.

Most quarterbacks, punters, and kickers are white, while almost all running backs, wide receivers, defensive backs, defensive linemen, safeties, punt returners, and kickoff returners are black.""""

Wikipedia is not the place to publish original research.  Wikipedia will only give a """"balanced view"""" if such a view can be supported with citations from published literature, preferably peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Equally important, Wikipedia is a reference encyclopedia that has an obligation to note that this hypothesis is not currently accepted by any mainstream, reputable medical organization (CCHR doesn't count, as they are neither reputable nor are they a medical organization).  

Perhaps, instead of attempting to convince the Wikipedia audience as to the veracity of these claims, you would be better off attempting to publish research and convince scientists and researchers of the validity of these claims using evidence.  You mention that you are a psychologist.  I do not know about psychologists across the pond, but in the US, the American Psychological Association, the specialty society that represents and speaks for American psychologists, has been quite clear in stating their support for the mainstream view that ADHD represents a serious neurological behavioral problem.  The American Psychological Association has also not endorsed this Social Construct hypothesis, and many of their statements contradict this hypothesis.

In fact, the APA even has a page set up specifically for ADHD:
http://www.apa.org/topics/topicadhd.html

Now, as I mentioned, I am not as familiar with practice in the UK, but I did manage to find the NICE clinical practice guidelines for ADHD.  They can be found here:
http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdf

In any event, the problem has nothing to do with anyone being """"wedded"""" to any notion, but rather that the proponents of this hypothesis have published very little research and have so far failed to convince the vast majority of researchers in their field as to the merits of their proposal.  First must come the research, the evidence, independently verifiable information that can be cited to support the hypothesis.  That must come first, before you can expect to see any sort of """"balanced view.""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

5286924267,"First I want to mention that I deeply appreciate your candid, frank, and friendly response.  It is refreshing to meet another Wikipedian who doesn't see any need to bite someone's head off just because of a mistake, whatever the size.  Not that most Wikipedians do that, but cordiality is still nice.  Yes, I agree that I should resist the urge to correct other people's comments.  For me, the ill will is a much bigger factor, especially because I always try to be very careful to never change the meaning of a comment, but it is still a risk, as you say.

You're right, the edits are old and the link eventually gets you there.  These are trivial changes, but I find value in them.  It is true that the servers don't spend much time on redirects, but I still would like all links going directly to the article they refer to.  Not that that will ever happen to all of WP, or even EN WP, but I can help.  Actually, I started fixing the redirecting links to that particular page because I wanted to make sure there were no double redirects, which would be a problem, and one worth fixing.  Being a perfectionist, I decided to go ahead and fix all the redirecting links instead of just the double redirects (I want a nice, clean Whatlinkshere page, with no indentions ).  A large percentage of the redirects I am fixing are on (main) namespace pages, not on talk pages, and in those cases I also fix the visible spelling of the link when it is wrong, since that should be right.  So I am doing what you were saying about fixing the article pages.  On talk pages (and even in archives), I have been fixing the appearance as well as the link target, but I think I'll change my policy based on your well-made point: I'm only going to change the link target, nothing about the appearance.  Does that seem reasonable?

I am interested in AWB, but I haven't really looked into it much.  Thanks for the tip.

My login problem is a toughie, as far as I can tell.  What happens is this: I click the register/login link at the top right of the page.  I enter my username and password.  It says I have successfully logged in, and even shows my username, etc., in the upper right.  But then, as soon as I switch to another page, I am logged out again.  I have checked my cookies, and I am accepting cookies from all Wikimedia projects that I'm working on.  It is possible it is a firewall problem, but I have no idea how to fix that.  And it isn't just at the school where I work: I can't login on computers in cybercafes in the area either.  Maybe they all have the same type of firewall or something, but I never had this problem until around December 2006, which was about the time our school changed its ISP.

I stopped reading it as an editor, and couldn't stop.  It felt like I was reading a story, one that captivated me, and as is often the case when I'm reading a story with a lot of players in it, I did forget who everyone was.  However, I was okay with that because that's often my experience when dealing with a large cast of characters.  I forget the details, like who did what and when and to whom, but I either go back and fill in what I've missed or forgotten about, or I was go with the flow and trust that the players are important.  The latter is what happened as I read this article.So this is my long-winded way of saying that perhaps forgetting the cast is part and parcel of the fact that so many people are involved.  Everyone's story is important, and you had to pick and choose what to include here.

I agree with most of what you said about Chicago.

But it's not as if people on the east or west coast don't have their criticism about the other coasts' culture as well.  East Coast people tend to think West Coast culture is too fluffy and superficial and West Coast people think the East Coast is too uptight and high-strung.  So I don't think how Chicago/Great Lakes culture is viewed by people on the coasts shoould really have any bearing on whether or not it's a """"coast.""""

Besides, I don't think the purpose is to compare the Great Lakes to the Eastern or Western seaboards.

Iranian V Persian
I see you asked about this on the Wiki Project Iran talkpage. Iranian, originally meant the Iranian peoples, which are a number of ethnic groups including the Persian people. The Iranian sate was named after the Iranian people and many dynasty's that ruled Iran historicly were not ethnically Persinal at all. Despite being known as Iran internally, for it's entire history, the Greeks refered to the country as Persia, in reference to the country's most important ethnic group at the time and this name was later adopted by the Roman's and then used throughotu the West until 1936 when Reza Shah got the Western states to officially recognise the country's name as Iran. Now although, in today's world """"Iranian"""" most commonly refers to citizen of Iran and """"Persian"""" to the ethnic group Persian people (not all of which are from Iran, since there are milions of ethnic Presians in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), with the term """"Iranic"""" being commonly used to refer to the """"Iranian Peoples"""" in the sense of all these different ethnic groups (Persians, Pashtuns, Kurds, Baluchis, ect.), however, due to wikipedia policies of English being Wikipedia's language here, Iran historicly is being refered to as the """"Persian Empire"""" or """"Persia"""" (which is infact a region in Iran), it's citizens as """"Persians"""" (although many of the notable Iranian citizens of the past weren't ethnic Persians and infact none of the kings of the """"Persian"""" empire from 1501 (re-establishment of Iranian state) until 1979 (abolishment of monarchy) were ethnic Persians) and so on wikipedia Iranian individuals prior to 1936 are refered to as Persians and Iran is refered to as Persia in articles concerning pre-1936 history.

Until and unless a fully balanced viewpoint is presented (ofcourse in compliance with WP:BLP) in the article, the tag cannot be removed.

Another editor (or perhaps it was the same) then suggested that it might be noteworthy if it involved some sort of legal analysis. The parties seemed to agree but then - inexplicably - left it in without explaining how Clinton's comparison amounts to a legal analysis. Exactly how does Clinton's statement that the case would go down in history as one of the worst SCOTUS cases along with Dred Scott amount to any sort of legal analysis?

7107055441,"""=== Page is in rough shape ===
With the recent purge of content, the page is not as informative as it once was.  The biggest problem is the first section which had the  """"proposed benefits of basic income"""" topic removed.  One editor may appear to hate naturalfinance.net, since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog.  Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.  For instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work, and the link to reciprocity is not online, and the topic not a major issue.  Both of those topics have good quality """"blog classifiable"""" sources available.

In order to Be Bold, I would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content, including from sources that are not government funded.  Basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda, and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article, and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening.  Barring this broadened content eligibility, we all need guidance for what is eligible content, and perhaps what makes naturalfinance.net ineligible.  (The content there was written in 2011, and has been adopted, whether independently or without attribution, by other authors)

Here is the major recent deletion https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basic_income&diff;=595677190&oldid;=595667344 .  Specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced.  Some of these can be sourced elsewhere, but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted:   

Proposed Benefits

naturalfinance.net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income:
 Wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don't spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do.
 Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.
 Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened
 Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.
 Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.
 Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.
 Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.
 Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.
 It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.
 Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.

 Here is a little something that I came up with myself

Let the boxes equal the letters A-V
Let the prize that you want to win be behind box A (It doesn't matter which box the prize you want to win is in, [also assume biggest prize])
Now if you pick box A, then the probability of getting through to the end of the game with the prize you want still in the game is 1(certain).
This occurs is (1/22) cases.
(1)*(1/22)=(1/22)

If you don't pick box A then the probability of you getting to the end of the game without taking out the prize you want is:

(20/21)*(19/20)*(18/19)... *(2/3). 

This can be re-written as:

(2*((20!)*(1!)))/(21!).

There is one very important thing to note here. In the sum, you don't multiply by 1/2, because you don't need to eliminate all of the boxes, just all but one (plus yours). This means that instead of dividing by (21!), you must divide by (21!)/(2) which is why there is a 2* on the top.

The sum works out with a value of (2/21) = 0.9523809524
This occurs is 21/22 cases so:

(21/22)*(2/21)= (1/11)

Therefore, you are twice as likely to be on the path where you didn't pick the prize you wanted (i.e. grand) first, which means that you should swap. Now there may be a flaw in my logic, and if there is then please point it out.82.26.43.91  15:46",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Marduk = Abraham. 

The early prophet line is reflected in all the history of the world.

Marduk is a regional variant of Abraham. So is Zoroaster.

Adam as we know him, was the first prophet of Dyeus, and the first human consciousness we see in history. Dyeus, became Zeus, Jupiter (with piter from fertilitycult distortions) and Yah, etc. """"God"""" ofcourse for many.
Idris was the second prophet of Tengri, which became """"Thor"""" many places sometimes god, sometimes more of a prophet, and again """"Indra"""", """"Prometheus"""", """"Osiris"""".
These concepts are known everywhere with local variations.
Knowing the regional names, one can see the same change in the regions who talk about Marduk, as here. A change from early prophetic teachings, to that of Abraham.

And Sarai of the Bible, is Saraswati in Hinduism, and Sarpanit here. Obviously we all have the same prophetic line, teaching monotheism. - God is without others.

 Symbolism of Benedictus Sextus Decimus resignation date announcement 

It should be noted that Joseph Ratzinger, ex-conscript in (Adolf) Hitler Youth, announced its resignation as Pope Benedict XVI on february 11th 2013, Benedict of Aniane and Adolf of Osnabrück feast day  Catholic online. February fest days: http://www.catholic.org/saints/f_day/feb.php. Maybe, this should be added in his biography.   
WP:SYNTH   
Close, but there's no conclusion. Not combining sources, just listing two. Just out of curiousity, NummerSechs, why should this be noted? Is there anything beyond it just being a sort of weird coincidence?  (talk) 02:22, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   
I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?  (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs  
It should be noted that February the 11th, Catholic Church also celebrates Notre Dame de Lourdes a.k.a Our Lady of Lourdes (south-west of France).

Therefore your edit was entirely inappropriate and for that reason I'm going to revert it. The block that you refer to was for using a 1-month-old consensus as the basis to protect an article from a gang of edit warriors. Whilst it's already fallacious due to the fact that it's entirely an ad hominem argument, it's even more dubious because you yourself are trying to use the discussion on this talk page as the basis to support Mzilikazi's illegal edits. If one reads the June 2012 discussion here, they'll see a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue. How is a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue justification for Mzilikazi's latest edit war when a 1-month-old consensus is apparently so worthless that I deserved to be blocked for implementing it?

Besides, this talk page certainly wasn't the entire discussion; you're cherry-picking and you know it full well. In reality, Mzilikazi conceded defeat in the first edit war here, hence both Aesop and Aesop's Fables returned to their BC/AD state after 1.5 years of Mzilikazi bullying anyone who tried to undo his illegal changes. The status quo was protected for many months until Mzilikazi used his sock puppet Afkun to start a 2nd edit war 7 months later. Mzilikazi was the original and main trouble-maker on your side of the first edit war, Dougweller, so by completely ignoring his concession of defeat and cherry-picking evidence in an attempt to claim you won is outrageous and shows just how little value one should place on your thoughts here.

 Examples 

""""Bitcoins can be exchanged between any two computers, provided each computer has bitcoin software and a wallet file. Some websites maintain wallet files (and bitcoin software) as a service to their users, allowing users to send and receive bitcoin even if they do not own a personal computer. No intermediate financial institution or government is required to verify transactions or transfer funds.""""

The above is not acceptable mainly because bitcoins are not solely exchanged between computers. That is not how the system operates entirely and it's in fact and understatement to the networking technology. A bitcoin transaction is simply signing the bitcoin address of another and transferring the coins. You can do that with any device. The website statement is misleading and implies people are trading bitcoins out of a library. That is not why these websites exist and you will need a citation for that claim. Even then, that's not where that claim belongs. The lead is for summarizing the article. Not adding more content. 

Also during this edit, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bitcoin&diff;=548172114&oldid;=548104412, you completely butchered the description on how the bitcoin ledger system operates. You talk about how transactions are confirmed but you totally deleted the big picture: Bitcoin is a giant transaction log based on cryptography. You are not literally sending coins to each other by reassigning balances through digital signatures that are confirmed as following the rules by the network. You are making things very vague and not easier to understand.

And again, you are making things inaccurate. If you continue to add unsourced and inaccurate material, I will be taking this to dispute resolution.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Because if it's """"already beginning"""" as you said, wouldn't that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?

I appreciate this.  I reverted  with just that 1 sentence 1 source addition.  I then requested to discuss it at the Talk page.  Question  So should I have first discussed it at the Talk page, and then asked it was acceptable for the article?  I thought on wikipedia I'm free to add something, and then discuss it.  Also, they reverted me.  I added the simple 1 sentence, and they reverted me 5+ times.  I'm not sure why the focus is on me warring with them, because they reverted me.  Could you clarify this?  Again, I added the simple sentence and national source (Outside Magazine) and I then asked to discuss it, and they reverted it 5+ times.  MONGO cited reasons such as the person is deceased, that the person took """"only 1 pill"""" of the prescription steroid (Outside article is on the use of steroids for performance enhancing on Everest), he commented in the Talk section that I should not be against the mountaineer, etc.  These all seem very unacceptable.  Highly biased journalism.  Almost laughably so.  And he didn't care to discuss it.  Fact:  The climber was reveled by Outside to have taken it, the Outside article is on """"Climbers Little Helper"""", subtitled """"a dangerous trend in mountaineering: rampant use of performance-enhancing drugs, particularly the powerful steroid dexamethasone.""""

In the interests of preventing the escalation of internecine conflict and ill-feeling between differing regional groups comprising the British Bangladeshi community, we hereby submit a list of requests for the administrators of Drishtipat London to implement. This should result in a more harmonious and co-operative environment in which DP London can hold conferences in Britain and continue it’s work in highlighting human rights abuses in Bangladesh and help make it a more effective organisation. Please signal your position regarding this communiqué. 

 
 

-The appointment of a British or Bangladeshi-born (Sylheti-speaking) Sylheti as executive of Drishtipat (DP) London. Thus accurately reflecting the overwhelmingly Sylheti character to the British Bangladeshi community and Sylheti concerns.

 

-An official statement of regret on the DP website that thorough research of the composition of the British Bangladeshi community was not initially undertaken. This oversight resulting in DP London conducting their campaign of 2006 on behalf of Dhaka-based garments workers. A worthy cause but one better suited for a DP Chapter whose constituency is less monolithic in it’s regional and cultural composition than Britain.

 

-Official confirmation that Faisal Ghazi (of Golmal blog fame) and Zubaer, DP members of ill-fame, have either been disciplined or preferably removed from DP’s campaigns. Their disparaging and outright racist remarks about British Sylheti’s on their blogs merits nothing less.

 

-The celebration of the achievements of ALL diaspora Bangladeshis. Not selected members such as author Tahmima Anam, (under the guise of concern for human rights) whom certain DP members may know from their time in Dhaka. This means the celebration of British Bangladeshi’s born and bought up in the UK as well, such as Rabina Khan and Abdul Ahad. 

 

-DP to become a genuine human rights organisation. This means concentration on bread and butter issues such as providing clean drinking water, inoculation and freedom from corruption and not 101 blog posts about the Awami League and the upcoming (irrelelevant) elections in Bangladesh. 

Drishtipat's greatest disservice to the Bangladeshi Human Rights/NGO sector is that they have made NGO work controversial by making it party-political. In Bangladesh anything deemed to be Pro-Awami League or Pro-BNP or Pro-Whatever useless party soon shrivells up and dies.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

you demanded some facts.  here you go;
Dursun Karatas was not born in 1953, but 1950.  most of the infos about Dursun Karatas at internet suggest he was born in 1953.  it is definately wrong. if you look at original Devrimci Sol court documents, you will see he was born 27 March 1950.  he has enrolled to Universityof Istanbul in 1967 at the age of 17.if he was born in 1953, it means he enrolled to university at the age og 14 which is not possible.  

In 1978 he founded Dev-Sol (Revolutionary Left, precursor of DHKP-C).[2] Karataş' group was based in Istanbul.[3]

this is not a fact.  the organisation was not based in Istanbul.  He was representative of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul branch when he established Devrimci Sol, splinter organisation from devrimci Yol.  Even turkish texas ranger that you used his report as a """"fact"""" states it, if you carefully read it.  Devrimci Sol is not based in Istanbul, but all over Turkey, especially, Adana, Izmir etc.

Karataş was jailed after the 1980 military coup. In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken. The Dev-Sol inmates at Bayrampaşa prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations. 

This is not true as well.  They have boycotted the torture and inhumane processes in prison.  Of course, torture is not mentioned at any documents or internet facts, but does not mean ut was existed.  The organisation protested torture in prison and Devrimci Sol started a hunger strikes, 4 inmates (sorry, terrorist for you and turkish texas ranger, bearing in mind, one of the terrorist lost his life during hunger strike was imprisoned with the accusation of putting up posters in the walls, punishable with 6 months imprisonment nowadays), lost their lives.  

In prison Karataş wrote Haklıyız Kazanacağız, a work which included analysis of past mistakes of the Dev-Sol movement and lists of enemies of the organization. It was published in two volumes in 1989, spanning more than 1000 pages.[3][4][5]

He did not write it, but all Devrimci Sol prisoners.  As a matter a fact Sinan Kukul prapered the book.  If you read the book earlier version you would see. (don't use sun glasses when you read it).  Lists of enemies of the organisation..... what a fuck is that.  there is no such thing in the book.  their past mistakes......  the book consisted with Devrimci Sol ideologies, its aim etc.      

He escaped from prison in 1989.[6] After escaping from jail, he went into exile in Europe.[4] In 1989-1990 Dev-Sol carried out a series of attacks. However, on July 12, 1991, Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization. Karataş fled to Europe. In April 1992 his wife Sahabat was killed by Turkish police.[3]

Following the police crackdown on Dev-Sol, Karataş was kidnapped and detained by the second-in-command of the movement, Bedri Yağan, on September 13, 1993. Karataş did however escape from captivity, and Dev-Sol was divided. Karataş and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP-C.[3]

following police crack down....   very funny, second in command bedri Yagan,.... this is a joke not fact.  Bedri Yagan was experiencin some problems theredore whatever his duties with in the organisation was removed before his action.  see Devrmci Sol Dava Dosyasi.  turkish texas ranger mentioned this in his report.

this is not your fault of course, the facts about the organisation and its leader were delibrately changed and munipilated by turkish security forces and its collobraters.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 I don't want Mies to complain after the fact that the wording was skewed.

The reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an """"infinitesimal"""" quantity must be equal.  The article Archimedean property has a section that explains why the reals have no non-zero strictly positive infinitesimal numbers.  Since 0.999... and 1 differ by at most an infinitesimal quantity, and the only such quanity in the reals is zero, 1 - 0.999... = 0 and thus 1 = 0.999...

 Anti-TKD slant 

I noticed that the article was changed to reflect a pro-foreign-influence slant.  I will eventually attempt to make appropriate edits in increments... edits made.  Comments welcome:  1. Introduction stated that TKD is an amalgamation of Chinese, Japan and Korean art.  While this may be factually true, it's a misleading introduction to TKD as many martial arts, including all forms of Karate, are amalgamations.  It serves no good purpose, other than NPOV agenda, to highlight this as an introduction to TKD.  2. Under """"development of TKD"""", controversies surrounding Karate's influence on TKD was overstated once again.  This topic is dealt with quite accurately in the Karate article.  It makes sense to follow that lead in this case.  It's misleading and NPOV the way it is written now.  3. Under """"traditional roots"""" TKD's foreign influence is again overstated.  Whoever, made these edits obviously had a pro-karate agenda.  The topic of foreign influence can be delt with in a fair and objective manner without being beaten to death under every subsection!  4. Under """"External Influence"""" foreign influence should be appropriately dealt with. 

The article is now overstating Taekwondo's relationship with Subak/Taekkyon; do we really need several long paragraphs all about """"Subak"""" (手搏) (whatever that was) and the Hwarang (whoever they really were) and Taekkyon supposedly slowly developing into Taekwondo over hundreds of years?  Taekkyon still exists today, so we can talk about Taekkyon's development in that article separately (noting that Taekkyon looks completely different from modern Taekwondo).  Japan's influences on Taekwondo are also well-documented, so why remove it?  Let's keep a neutral point of view for this article.  At this point, it sounds like the first few pages of a Taekwondo student's guide.

I think this needs to be looked into more carefully but history of Korean martial arts is a very relevant part of tkd.  Let's leave the text as is until we can sort this out.  I also have to say that your dismissive attitude isn't very POV.  Instead of blindly defending or rejecting labels, we need to deconstruct ideas and arguments and go through them with a fine comb.  Regardless of what you want to call it, Koreans have been kicking in fights and contests for thousands of years and documentation for this exists as far back as the three kingdoms era.  Chosun documentation also exists that show that Subak was part of the formal requirements for entrance into Chosun military and large Taekyon tournaments held by the populace well into the 1800's.  Most of Korean folk arts and traditional Korean disciplines existed and even thrived during the Chosun dynasty without formalization or systemization(e.g. korean wrestling called ssirum, pan sori, musical instruments, minstrels, etc.).  But the absence of formal schools, teachers and formal links doesn't mean that those arts weren't passed down or that they didn't exist.    While tkd isn't taekyon, tkd is a product of Korean attempts at formalizing a Korean martial art.  In an objective inquiry into TKD's origins, you need to understand the history and culture of Korean martial arts, culture and history.  To leave this out would be erroneously simplistic.  The martial arts aspect of Korean culture(folk culture during Chosun times) provides the basis for the formalization and systemization that Korean martial arts goes through in the 1900's.  TKD claims this, history and culture of Korean arts and disciplines provides the background for this, and the actual practice of tkd bears this out.  To ignore all this and look only for and only accept formal links between masters, students, formal schools, etc., is NPOV and more importantly wouldn't reflective objective reality behind TKD's conception.

btw.  There's a lot of crap out there about a lot of Korean martial arts but Hwarang are mentioned in Korean historical documents, Subak is mentioned countless times in military, historical records including Chosun records.  Taekyon was a part of Subak and its popularity was well documented by during Chosun times in its mention of Taekyon tournaments that were held well into the 1800's.   

To keep this (relatively) short, just a few points:

1. We know that """"Subak"""" has been mentioned in the Mooyedobotongji and other sources, but we don't really know exactly what """"Subak"""" actually referred to.  In China, the same word (pronounced """"Shoubo"""") was used as a general term for barehand martial arts, however - thus, it is likely that Koreans used the same word in the same way (as it was a loanword).
2. Hwarang are of course mentioned in many Korean texts, but we don't actually know",0,0,0,0,0,0

During our regular monitoring of social media and our internet reputation, members of the Marketing department at Raymond James noticed that much of the information on this page is outdated and/or incomplete.  We would like to take a more proactive approach to updating this information with current numbers, etc.  We are not sure who was responsible for originally writing the page, and we would like to make edits so that it reads less like a promotional piece/advertisement.

We would also like to put the following """"Controvery"""" section up for discussion.  This section was recently posted on the page, and reads unobjectively.  Many of the claims are not reliablity sourced, and the extensiveness of the section was disproportionate relative to both the size of our page and similar sections on competitors' pages.  We have left three of our majo/significant events on the page, and are including the smaller/unsourced claims here for discussion.  We are open to discussing how best to frame this section so that it reads more objectively.

Controversy

Raymond James has had been one of the most controversial firms with 49 regulatory events and 61 finalized arbitration's including housing several ponzi schemes according to Finra.http://brokercheck.finra.org/Support/ReportViewer.aspx In spite of all the controversy that surrounds Raymond James, the firm has been vocal about trying to prevent any increase in regulation of the financial services industry.http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0813601120101108 
Some of the most notable controversies have included:

In 1997, Charles LeCroy, a Raymond James banker, helped issue bonds in Jefferson County through a noncompetitive process. These bonds ended up funding corrupt activities and led to the county's bankruptcy.http://46in08.blogspot.com/2009/08/death-of-jefferson-county-alabama-and.html

In 2000, NASD regulators censured Raymond James & Associates, Inc. for “yield burning” activities on municipal securities. yield burning involves overcharges by brokerage firms on Treasury securities purchased with proceeds from the sale of municipal bonds. Yield burning by brokerage firms jeopardized the tax-exempt status of interest paid to holders of those bonds.The multi-million dollar settlement resolved the civil fraud charges under the False Claims Act against Raymond James. The payments made by Raymond James will also resolve certain tax-related claims of the Internal Revenue Service.http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2000-45.txt

In 2000, Raymond James was paid $650,000 to undertake the merger of HomeGold with smaller firms. The minimal amount of due diligence conducted by the firm prevented them from discovering the fraud that was going on. The parent firm later went bankrupt causing millions in losses and one of the biggest fraud cases in the state of South Carolina.http://www.usatoday.com/money/2004-02-05-homegold_x.htm

In 2003, Raymond James was found guilty of overcharging investors who made large purchases of mutual funds. There were nearly 160,000 trades that were overcharged and Raymond James had no systems in place to capture these trades.,http://www.txcm.com/reports/Raymond%20James%20mutual%20trading%20scandal.pdfhttp://registeredrep.com/institutions/raymondjames/finance_raymond_james_audits/

In 2005, the NASD fined Raymond James $750,000 for violations stemming from a failure to supervise the firm’s fee-based brokerage accounts.

In 2007, three ex-Raymond James employees sued, saying they were paid less than men and denied opportunities.http://www.sptimes.com/2007/10/21/Business/Women_claim_sex_bias_.shtml

In 2008, Jerry Rose was found to be conducting a ponzi scheme using Raymond James as custodian to the assets which amounted to over $16 million.http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/06/16/story13.html

In 2008, Raymond James received lots of criticism for using obscure provisions under SOX in which they denied whistle-blowing claims on the basis that the claims were made against a subsidiary company.http://whistlersear.wordpress.com/tag/sox-whistleblower/ These laws were reversed when the new Frank Dowd act was put into place on July 21, 2010. Raymond James was mentioned as one of the companies that abused the laws, as a means to conduct ethical and legal grounds. This included the case of John Hughart v. Raymond James in which the complaints regarding lax supervision in compliance was overlooked on the grounds that the employee worked a a subsidiary and therefore had no opportunity for restitution from Raymond James.http://www.oalj.dol.gov/Decisions/ALJ/SOX/2004/HUGHART_JOHN_v_RAYMOND_JAMES_and_AS_200",0,0,0,0,0,0

Something to consider, is that the references you pointed to – which are part of a larger list  are very old and are based on work done in the early years of AIDS; also, that subsequent research has not supported the same results.

The primary issue when reviewing the studies most often referenced by someone trying to link nitrites to AIDS, or more specifically to Kaposi’s sarcaoma, is that they are very weak in terms of data presented.  The results have not been repeated by other scientists.  In fact, within the list of referenced studies, there are contradictory results both by the same researcher and between different researchers.

The general consensus in the research community, and in the HIV/AIDS community, is that although the much vaunted list of references claiming to link nitrites to HIV/AIDS may look impressive to the untrained eye, they do not support a case for a claim that nitrite use causes HIV infection or Kaposi’s sarcaoma (KS).",0,0,0,0,0,0

If you did reach out to Clan Davidson, that was a wise thing to do. Who they say they descend from carries much more weight than others who might have an interest in slandering their name.

I've seen many people say that they can understand a different language on the discussion page and then list the languages as mutually intelligible. That is just one-sided intelligibility. Intelligibility differs from person to person and also depends on what is being said. For instance, if you're Russian you may understand a Polish guy completely, but your Russian friend may have no idea what's going on. And if the Polish guy says something else, you might not understand him at all. It is very hard to study intelligibility because there is so much variation. So just because you understand (or don't understand) something in a related language it does not mean that is the case for all speakers (or even most speakers) and it definitely does not guarantee it goes the other way around.
Mutual intelligibility is not one guy being able to understand something in another language. This is an example of mutual intelligibility:

A Polish guy is in the Czech Republic and asks a Czech guy for directions (in Polish). The Czech understands what he is saying and tells him where to go (in Czech). The Polish guy understands and finds where he needs to go.

If the Polish guy didn't understand then it is not mutual intelligibility. And this has to happen for a lot of people, not just those two guys. Alex",0,0,0,0,0,0

Read very closely .
Per WP:VERIFY and WP:BURDEN, the burden of proof that the image shows Godane has already been proven through the many, upon many reliable and reputable sources. You seem to have an issue with this, therefore the onus has now been transferred to you in order to prove to the contrary, something which you have so far failed to do. 
None of the sources you have cited have explicitly denied the authenticity of the image. They have merely used a different image of Godane. This does not support your contention that the image which is being discussed here, which is used by sources more reliable and reputable (e.g United States State Department , BBC and Reuters, among others) against the sources which you have cited, of which I have not heard of any one of them ( 'Suna times' and 'Waamo news'). 
No, there are not """"multiple images on Godane"""", there are only two: The one being discussed here, and the one you consistently regurgitate. Yes, it won't make the other various portraits vanish. This still dose't help you, becuase through the above sources, it is seen which image is clearly favored by the more reliable sources. This source here,  is the only thing that you have showed me which highlights that the image may not be Godane. I bet you're smiling and clapping your hands right now that through this magical source you have proven the image is not Godane, right? WRONG. This source is meager. It is unreliable as it is questionable. The article is a blog, unworthy of proper accreditation, and it's riddled with spelling errors and grammatical errors, e.g (""""Hammami is still advocating for Robow’s troopss."""") Are you kidding me? The author can't even spell, and you're taking this blog over acclaimed sources such as Reuters or the U.S State Department. Wow is all I can say. Furthermore, the blog doesn't identity which picture is incorrect (If indeed any image is incorrect, the author never cites his source), and the article was published over a year before those media sources cited above circulated the image being discussed here. Moreover, even if the images were used prior, it still doesn't help, as the author hasn't established where he got his information from concerning this supposed 'incorrect' image of Godane. Again, you're going to have to do more digging than that in order to prove your point.
The basis that 'foreign media agencies' have no credibility on reporting in areas where local media is present is just well, stupid. By that logic, any material/information coming from any part of the world which is not from the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe already excludes many of those sources. This geographical argument is meaningless. Ok then, how about I remove all references to BBC,Reuters, Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, the National Counterterrorism Center (Oh look, they use the image as well! ) and many, many more sources just becuase they are reporting from places where they are not 'based'? Hmm? Seems reasonable logical to me, if we were to follow your logic. What you are forgetting is that each news agency, no matter if its western gets its information from local sources from the places where they are covering a story or reporting from, whether that's Somalia or Timbuktu. This source for example from BBC  is from the BBC African branch, BBC Africa. They will have reporters, correspondents, sources, all across Africa. And this is only one media source. The Somalian media are going to be no more accurate than BBC Africa , as they will not have the extensive resources that the BBC have, even in Somalia but also elsewhere.
And finally, this. """"the various portraits can perhaps go in the body as StantheMan87 suggested """" -. So now you're willing to compromise? Ahh, I see!
